# Photo Discovery and Management App

## Project Idea
The **Photo Discovery and Management App** is designed to provide users with an immersive experience for discovering, searching, and managing photos. Utilizing the Pexels API, the app offers a rich photo experience with an engaging splash screen featuring animation, onboarding screens, powerful search functionality, the ability to save and view favorite photos, and intuitive photo management features.

## Functionality
- **Splash Screen**: A splash screen with an animated title. It includes a binding variable showSplash to control the visibility of the splash screen and an 
    internal state animate to manage the fade-in and scaling animation of the text.
- **Onboarding Screens**: A sequence of screens that introduces users to the app's features, with interactive elements to guide them through its capabilities.
- **Photo Discovery**: Integration with the Pexels API to fetch and display a diverse range of photos, including a search feature for personalized photo discovery.
- **User Interface**: A responsive and visually appealing UI built with SwiftUI, including a grid view for photos and detailed views for individual images.
- **Asynchronous Data Loading**: Use of Combine to handle data fetching and image loading asynchronously, with caching mechanisms to enhance performance.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to provide clear messages and fallback views in case of data fetching failures or no data availability.

## Technology Stack
- **Platform**: iOS
- **Language**: Swift
- **Frameworks**:
  - **SwiftUI**: For building the app's user interface with modern, declarative syntax.
  - **Combine**: For managing asynchronous data loading and reactive programming.
- **API Integration**: Pexels API for fetching photo data.
- **Data Management**: Combine for reactive programming and SwiftUI for UI components.
- **Image Caching**: NSCache for efficient image handling and performance optimization.

## Project Proposal

   - Fades in and scales up the title "One Picture, Infinite Words!" when the view appears.
   - Automatically hides after a 2-second delay.
1. **Develop a User-Friendly Onboarding Experience**:
   - Create an engaging onboarding flow introducing core features.
   - Include interactive elements to guide users through the appâ€™s functionalities.
2. **Implement Photo Discovery Features**:
   - Integrate with the Pexels API to fetch and display a wide range of photos.
   - Implement search functionality to allow users to find photos based on their preferences.
3. **Design an Intuitive User Interface**:
   - Use SwiftUI to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
   - Include features like a grid view for photos and detailed views for individual photos.
4. **Handle Asynchronous Data Loading**:
   - Utilize Combine to manage asynchronous data fetching and image loading.
   - Implement caching mechanisms to optimize performance and reduce network requests.
5. **Ensure Robust Error Handling**:
   - Display user-friendly error messages when data fetching fails.
   - Provide fallback views and actions for users in case of errors or no data availability.

### Features
